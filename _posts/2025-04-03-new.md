Hello there newbie 'Me',  
> (if it's someone else reading this, stop here. It's not for you. Bye bye.)
<p> 
at the time of writting this for you I am not sure what is happening. I created "title:" at 
least 3x in 3 different files and no idea of where they are. 
<br>
So if this excerpt makes itself into the final product, I will be very surprised. Because I doubt it would. 
<br>
Who do I report to if our files are missing...?

**Finally, I solved this STEP 4. of course maybe the "_config.yml" slight error had a part to play. <br>
however undoubtly the biggest issue was the PERIOD in the TITLE,**<br>
**No wonder the *PREVIEW* TAB did not show up. <br>**

**[Keep an eye out for that always, because GITHUB is SUPPOSE to work]**
<br>
**SOO , do NOT put a PERIOD after the md,
10 mins I will never get back because of my stupity. <br>
now its ok. YEAAAA LESSGO.**
